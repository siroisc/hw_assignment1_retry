Dr. Shen,

My Assignment 1 submission on Titanium included a comment that explains the reason for my incomplete github repository. To reiterate, my initial push resulted in an AndroidStudio error: " MyApplication: push to origin/master was rejected. app\src: ERROR: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. I have spent several hours trying to find the solution to my project, which resulted in making creating a new SSH id_rsa encrypted key and syncing it with my account on github. This gave me a resulting error, which then resulted in logging out of my git bash account and trying to do the same process with a newly created account. This fixed the first authentication error, but when I opened up my version control window on Android studio, I saw that my project had 7 commits, push, merge attempts that made me give up and make a new project with the exact same files that were required for Assignment 1. My first submission only included the GridLayoutActivity.java and gridlayout_activity_main.xml, and a .zip file that was my whole app project. The contents in this github repository is exactly the same as the ones I supplied for the github repository link in my original submission. I will be at your office hours today to explain this to you in person with my laptop to recreate the problem if need be.
